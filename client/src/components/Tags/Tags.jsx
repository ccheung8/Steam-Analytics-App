        Tags on Steam are more user driven as they can be applied by developers,
        players, and Steam moderators. Tags allow for a more specific
        description of the game and can include descriptors related to genre,
        visual properties, themes and moods, and features. Tags have a weight
        that fluctuates based on how customers tag the game and the developer's
        set tags. They are ordered from most to least weight and the top 5 tags
        should paint a fairly clear picture of the game. Select tag(s) to browse
        games by tag.
